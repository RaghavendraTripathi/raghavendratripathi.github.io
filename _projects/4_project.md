## Sierpinski's Example
Sierpinski produced an example of a holomorphic function on disk whose power series converges at every point at the boundary of disk but the function is not continuous at any point on the disk. The original paper is in French. There must be better translations of the paper. But here is my attempt at translating it after learning French for 3 days. [Here](https://raghavendratripathi.github.io/assets/pdf/Serpienski_Example.pdf) is the pdf.

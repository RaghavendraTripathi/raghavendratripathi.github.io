I am Raghavendra Tripathi, currently a 4th year PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Soumik Pal](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~soumik/). We are currently investigating optimization problems on graphons. I am also interested in random matrix theory and optimal transport.

Before coming to Seattle, I received my Master's degree in mathematics from [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.math.iisc.ac.in), Bangalore. Outside mathematics I am interested in linguistics and poetry.

I am Raghavendra Tripathi. I am a postdoctoral associate at New York University, Abu Dhabi, where I work with [Pierre Youssef](https://wp.nyu.edu/pyoussef/). 

I did my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Soumik Pal](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~soumik/) at the University of Washington, Seattle.  Before going to Seattle, I received my Master's degree in mathematics from [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.math.iisc.ac.in), Bangalore. Outside of mathematics, I am interested in linguistics and poetry.

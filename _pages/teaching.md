### Courses
#### Instructor
- **Introduction to Mathematical Thinking**, *Summer 2022*
	- I designed this course for the Robinson Center at UW. The course was aimed at bright high-school students to introduce them to methods of proofs in mathematics and its importance.
- **Analysis Prelim Prep**, *Summer 2021*
	- A preparatory course for the qualifying exam for first/second year graduate students.
- **Math 309**, *Summer 2021*
	- An undergraduate course covering differential equations and Fourier methods

	
#### TA (with Office Hours)
- **Math 534**, Spring 2021
- **Math 525**, Autumn 2022
- **Math 465**, Winter 2023
- **Math 464**, Spring 2020
- **Math 424**, Winter 2020, Summer 2020, Autumn 2020, Winter 2021, Autumn 2021

#### WDRP ([Washington Directed Reading Program](https://sites.uw.edu/wdrp/))
######## WDRP is a 1-credit course offered as Math 398. Typically 1-2 student mentee(s) are assigned to a graduate mentor. It is a fun way to explore interesting areas of mathematics! Below is the list of projects that I have mentored at UW.
- **Introduction to computational complexity**, *Spring 2023*, Student: Sam Tacheny
- **Magical Mathematics**, *Winter 2023*, Student: Daria Akselrod
- **Large networks and graph limits**, *Autumn 2022*, Student: Tianyang (Terence) Wang
- **Introduction to random matrix theory**, *Autumn 2021*, Student: Mark Lamin
- **von Neumann inequality for matrices**, *Spring 2020*, Students: Fedor Pogulsky and Zuo Wang
- **What is Mathematics?**, *Winter 2020*, Students: Roark Wolf and Reece Peters

#### WXML [Washinton Experimental Math Lab](http://www.wxml.math.washington.edu/?page_id=370)
######## WXML is a unique program at UW where a faculty, a graduate student and a group of undergraduate students come together to explore mathematics. Following is a list of cool projects that I was part of. I also say a line or two about the projects below, for more details click on the projects or write an email to me.

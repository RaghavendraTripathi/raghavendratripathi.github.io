### Courses
#### Instructor
- **Introduction to Mathematical Thinking**, *Summer 2022*
	- I designed this course for the Robinson Center at UW. The course was aimed at bright high-school students to introduce them to methods of proofs in mathematics and its importance.
- **Analysis Prelim Prep**, *Summer 2021*
	- A preparatory course for the qualifying exam for first/second year graduate students.
- **Math 309**, *Summer 2021*
	- An undergraduate course covering differential equations and Fourier methods

### WDRP ([Washington Directed Reading Program](https://sites.uw.edu/wdrp/))
###### WDRP is a 1-credit course offered as Math 398. Typically 1-2 student mentee(s) are assigned to a graduate mentor. It is a fun way to explore interesting areas of mathematics! Below is the list of projects that I have mentored at UW.
- *Introduction to computational complexity*, Spring 2023
	--Student: Sam Tacheny
- *Magical Mathematics*, Winter 2023
	--Student: Daria Akselrod
- *Large networks and graph limits*
	--Student: Tianyang (Terence) Wang
- *Introduction to random matrix theory*, Autumn 2021
	--Student: Mark Lamin
- *von Neumann inequality for matrices*, Spring 2020
	--Students: Fedor Pogulsky and Zuo Wang
- *What is Mathematics?*, Winter 2020
	-- Students: Roark Wolf and Reece Peters

### WXML (Washinton Experimental Math Lab)

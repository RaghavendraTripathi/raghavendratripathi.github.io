Parveen Shakir is one of the most loved and distinctive Urdu poetess. Parveen Shakir is credited with brining the feminine touch to Urdu ghazals. She published 6 volumes of poetry in her short life. Her first poetry book is Khushbu (Fragrance). Khushbu was published first in Pakistan in Urdu. It seems that a Devanagari version of Khushbu was published in India, but I could not get hold of it. At the request of dear Khushbu, I made an attempt to transliterate the book [Khushbu into devanagari script](https://raghavendratripathi.github.io/assets/pdf/Misc/Lit/khushbu.pdf). 

P.S.: It seems that after converting the word file into pdf, the nuqtas have disappeared at places. If you want to get the word file to proofread it or correct the mistakes, I would be grateful to you. Please do write to me. 

P.S.S.: Someday, I will stop procrastinating and fix the typos and nuqtas, but till then, enjoy reading this full-of-mistakes-version of Khushbu!
